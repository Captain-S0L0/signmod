# SignMod

A mod providing tools for modifying signs in Minecraft version 1.8.

## Installing

1) Install [Legacy Fabric](https://legacyfabric.net/downloads.html) for Minecraft 1.8.
2) Download the latest jar from the [latest releases](https://github.com/Captain-S0L0/signmod/releases)
3) Plop that into your .minecraft/mods folder
4) Enjoy!

## Features

Whenever you open a Sign, you'll now be presented with a few new text boxes which you can enter **commands**!

You can enter up to 4 per sign (1 per line), and when the sign is right-clicked, they will all be executed in top to bottom order.

These commands will execute with operator level **4** in Minecraft versions 1.8-1.8.4, and can be created **without cheats or op in survival!**

In 1.8.5 and beyond, these signs will only execute with operator level 2, the same as command blocks. Commands also will not automatically be updated to new syntaxes, so it might be wise to create signs with both older and newer command syntaxes.

Anyways, that's basically "all" this mod does. Have fun. Or not.
